What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Answer 2: Software engineering is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining a software. It's about using organized and methodical ways to make sure software works well, is reliable, and meets the needs of its users. It consist of the design, development, testing,
deployment, and maintenance of software products.

Software Engineering covers the entire process of software development, including project management, requirement gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. where as Traditional Programming focuses primarily on the coding aspect, which is just one part of the software development process.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:


Answer 3: 

Requirement Analysis:

This phase involves gathering and analyzing the requirements from the users. The goal is to understand what the software should do.

Design:

This phase focuses on planning the software architecture and design. It translates the requirements into a blueprint for building the software.

Implementation :

The actual code is written in this phase based on the design documents. Developers create the software according to the specified requirements.

Testing:

This phase is about verifying and validating the software to ensure it meets the specified requirements and is free of defects.

Deployment:

The software is released and made available for use. This phase involves installing and configuring the software in the target environment.

Maintenance:

After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase where it is updated and improved to fix bugs and add new features.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Answer 4: 

4.Waterfall Model:

The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. It follows a strict order: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.

Agile Model:

The Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach that promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, and continuous improvement. It involves breaking the project into small, manageable units called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks.

Agile integrates testing throughout the development process, while Waterfall performs testing after implementation.

So in scenarios where Projects with rapidly changing or unclear requirements and Environments where frequent user feedback is beneficial. Agile will be used 
And on Projects where documentation and a clear roadmap are critical and working with smaller projects with straightforward requirements and low complexity Waterfall can be used.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:


Answer 2: 
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It is a critical activity in the software development lifecycle, ensuring that the final product meets the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Answer:
Modularity refers to the design principle of breaking a software system into distinct, independent units or modules, each encapsulating a specific piece of functionality. Each module interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces and is designed to perform a single task or a group of related tasks. This separation allows each module to be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

modularity improves maintainability by isolating changes, enhancing understandability, promoting reusability, enabling parallel development, and simplifying testing. It enhances scalability by allowing independent scaling, flexible deployment, performance optimization, load balancing, and incremental growth




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Answer:
1. Unit Testing:
Checks small pieces of the software, like individual functions or modules, to see if they work correctly on their own.

2. Integration Testing:
Testing how different parts of the software work together. So, instead of just checking individual pieces, you're checking how they all interact.



3. System Testing:
Testing the entire software as one big system to see if it behaves correctly and meets all the requirements.


4. Acceptance Testing:
Testing if the software meets the needs of the people who will be using it (like customers or end-users).


Testing is crucial in software development because it helps identify bugs, ensure quality and reliability, reduce costs and risks, validate requirements and design, improve maintainability and scalability, build confidence and trust, ensure compliance and regulation, and facilitate continuous improvement. It is an essential aspect of the software development lifecycle that contributes to the overall success of software projects.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

ANswer:
A version control system is a software tool that keeps track of every change made to the source code and also promotes coordiation among team members.

Version Control Systems Important becouse you can save different versions of the project, see who made each change and when, compare different versions to see what changed. and go back to a previous version if something goes wrong.


Examples of Popular Version Control Systems:

Git:
Features:
Distributed: Everyone has a full copy of the project, allowing them to work offline.
Branching: Developers can create separate branches to work on new features without affecting the main project.
Merging: Git makes it easy to merge changes from different branches back into the main project.


Subversion (SVN):
Features:
Centralized: There's a central repository where everyone checks in their changes.
Branching and Merging: Suberversion supports branching and merging, but it's not as flexible as Git.
File Locking:  allows developers to lock files they're working on to prevent conflicts.
